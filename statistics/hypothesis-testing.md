# Hypothesis Testing (with Future Work)

Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure of testing your ideas about the world using statistics.

Null hypothesis ($H_0$) and Alternate hypothesis ($H_1$)

Low within group variance & high between group variance : low p-value

Does independent variable affect dependent variable?

- Null hypothesis : Independent variable does not affect dependent variable.
- Alternative hypothesis : Independent variable affects dependent variable.

The **significance level**, or alpha (α), is a value that the researcher sets in advance as the threshold for statistical significance. It is the maximum risk of making a false positive conclusion (Type I error) that you are willing to accept.

APA guidelines advise reporting not only *p* values but also effect sizes and confidence intervals wherever possible to show the real world implications of a research outcome.

In statistics, a **Type I error** is a false positive conclusion, while a **Type II error** is a false negative conclusion.
