# Precision & Recall 

## Precision 

Precision attempts to answer the following question: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?*

Precision is defined as follows 

$$Precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$

**Note :** A model that produces no false positives has a precision of 1.0. 

## Recall 

Recall attempts to answer the following question: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?*

Recall is defined as follows: 

$$Recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$

**Note :** A model that produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.
