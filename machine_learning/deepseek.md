- It's became famous after the release of DeepSeek-R1.
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:7b) added the model to its repository, along with a bunch of other models distilled using DeepSeek.
- They uploaded various models to [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai)
- Their [API Documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)
- [open-r1](https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1) is a huggingface project aiming to fully reproduce DeepSeek-R1
- [Janus](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus) is another DeepSeek project training Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models
